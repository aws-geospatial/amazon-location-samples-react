# Display markers on a web map using React

This example demonstrates how to display markers on a web map using [React](https://react.dev/), [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/), and [Amazon Location's authentication helper](https://github.com/aws-geospatial/amazon-location-utilities-auth-helper-js). It uses [Amazon Location Service's Maps](https://aws.amazon.com/location/) as the base map provider and [MapLibre GL
JS](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/) (via [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/)) as the map rendering library with authentication managed by [Amazon Location's authentication helper](https://github.com/aws-geospatial/amazon-location-utilities-auth-helper-js).

## Create resources

Click the button below to create the necessary AWS resources for this sample app to run. It will
open the AWS Management Console and initiate the CloudFormation template deployment process.

[![Launch Stack](https://amazon-location-cloudformation-templates.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cfn-launch-stack-button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/quickcreate?stackName=react-map-with-markers-example&templateURL=https://amazon-location-cloudformation-templates.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/samples/web-react-map-with-markers/template.yaml)

Once the deployment process is complete, go to the **Outputs** section to get the Amazon Cognito
Identity Pool ID, AWS Region, and Map resource name.

## Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and populate environment variables with the CloudFormation stack
outputs.

## Run

Run `npm start` to start a local web server on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000/) with this
example and open it in a browser.

## Clean up

To remove all of the resources created in this walkthrough, delete the CloudFormation stack named
`react-map-with-markers`.
